# air-pollution-prediction-lstm
This is a Master's degree project done by students of Singidunum University. The code contained here is referenced by the project ___ ??? . 

To install this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the project locally by running `git clone https://github.com/Zamachi/air-pollution-prediction-lstm/blob/main/README.md` in your terminal of choice. Obviously you need to have Git version control installed and in your **PATH** variable
2. Change into the project directory, where the file `requirements.txt` is at
3. (Optional) Create a *virtual environment* to install packages to by running `python -m venv ./path/to/new/virtual/environment` e.g. `python -m venv .venv` will create a virtual environment called "*.venv.*" in your current working dir.
4. Activate the virtual environment by running the "**Activate**" script. On Windows machines it's located in "*$VENV_NAME/Scripts/Activate*" and you can use either Powershell or Command Prompt Scripts. On Linux machines it is located in "*$VENV_NAME/bin/Activate*". So, what I do on Windows is run this in my terminal e.g "*./.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1*".
5. Once activated, install packages listed in `requirements.txt` file by running `pip -r requirements.txt`.
